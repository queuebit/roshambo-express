## Roshambo with Node and Express
This is a simple test api-like app I am making after doing the [Code School Building Blocks of ExpressJS](http://campus.codeschool.com/courses/building-blocks-of-express-js) course.

### Routes
* `/` --> Hello World
* `/roshambo` --> Rock, Paper, or Scissors please 
* `/roshambo/penny` --> You threw a penny
